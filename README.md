# CAESER üèõÔ∏è

A decentralized Web3 application on the Sui blockchain that brings real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain through tokenization, cross-chain swapping, and peer-to-peer lending.

## üåü Overview

CAESER enables users to invest in tokenized assets (properties, bonds), perform cross-chain token swaps, mint NFTs for property documents, and engage in peer-to-peer lending using tokenized assets as collateral. Built with compliance in mind, the platform includes a built-in KYC flow to ensure only verified users can access RWA functions.

Each physical asset is represented by an NFT-like on-chain token ‚Äì a real-world asset NFT ‚Äì encoding ownership of real property or securities. By leveraging Sui's parallel-processing architecture for high throughput and low fees, combined with Wormhole's cross-chain bridges, CAESER targets the large market of asset tokenization and compliant DeFi.
